#Experiment 2: Styled blog post 


##Description
This is a fun and creative HTML & CSS webpage inspired by "How to Train Your Dragon" — but with cats as the main characters.
The page features:
A cat gallery before the dragon training steps.
A step-by-step "dragon" (cat) training guide.
A soft fantasy-themed background for an immersive feel.
It combines semantic HTML elements with custom CSS styling,gradients, and images to create a visually appealing layout.
